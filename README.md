# Realtime_helmet_risk_identification_in_traffic

### Live Link - https://helmet-risk.vercel.app/

This is a web application which internally uses the api which we have created for real time helmet risk identification which is trained on 10 thousand images which is having classes such as 


1. Helmet
2. Risk
3. Rider
4. License_plate
5. Pedestrian


You can axcess the webpage by logging in as USER NAME - admin , PASSWORD: password , then using your camers you can have live detections for all the above mentioned classes

#### NOTE - as this is real time problem it would take lot more time to improve ad there should be more annotated dataset of thousands of images , for further developmet we aim to extract the Number Plate of a bike which has no helmet and we will send real time messages to their phone numbers(owners of motorcycle) and the police as well , not only that we also aim to download their photo and embed them in a link and send it using twillio module
